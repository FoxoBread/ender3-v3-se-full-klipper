# ender3-v3-se-full-klipper

Configuration files for Klipper for Ender3 V3 SE.

With current control for stepper motors.
Now the motors do not overheat.

This is a complete configuration, it is enough for Klipper to work fully.

There is also a compiled file klipper.bin  v0.11.0-303, but I recommend compiling this file yourself.

After installation you need to do:
1. calibrate Z-offset
2. Bed mesh calibrate
3. Calibrate bed and extruder PID.
