# ender3-v3-se-full-klipper

Configuration files for Klipper for Ender3 V3 SE.

With current control for stepper motors.
Now the motors do not overheat.

This is a complete configuration, it is enough for Klipper to work fully.

There is also a compiled file klipper.bin, but I recommend compiling this file yourself.
